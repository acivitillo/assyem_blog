About

Business analytics is on the rise, data is everywhere, business is booming. But the devil is in the detail and you can see there is a lot of nonsense in the industry. Companies buy solutions that have the best sales teams, not the best products. Disasters occur in the process.

At **Assyem** I write about business analytics from its foundation, which, believe it or not, is data and more specifically data handling and operations. I believe that foundations don't change as quickly as BI products. That we have been through enough hypes and that the new one is always around the corner. So we must focus on the things that are here to stay and will not change with the next wave of tools.
