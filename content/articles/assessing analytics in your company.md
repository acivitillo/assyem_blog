Assessing Analytics Practice
2019-10-26
Process

I often get emails from people working in companies that are going through or want to go through some type of analytics transformation. As I worked with those individuals it became quite clear that the first step we should take is a robust assessment of the current state and the future that we want to achieve.

Assessing an analytics and BI department, however, can be daunting work. 99% of the managers I talk to tell me, with no doubts, that data and analytics are important and key to the company's survival. Yet analytics projects still fail at very high rates. For instance [85% of AI projects fail](http://customerthink.com/why-85-of-the-artificial-intelligence-projects-fail/).

This creates a dichotomy: on one end the company is stressing that analytics must deliver results; on the other end somehow those results are not coming. The final outcome is that our job becomes less relevant, it's paid less, understood less, and our customers seem to be always unhappy (which then results in higher turnover, higher dissatisfaction, etc.).

Similar overlapping company functions, like finance, are held in higher regard and even paid more. If you check numbers in Payscale and Glassdoor you will notice this trend: finance professionals tend to earn more money than BI/Analytics professionals in Central Europe. This is interesting because we both work with data and numbers--why then a difference in market value?

As we go through an assessment of our analytics function and come up with future direction, we need to keep all of the above in mind. I believe one of the biggest goals of an analytics assessment and subsequent transformation is making the function **more relevant**.

### Do we own KPIs the company cares about?
You are wondering why finance people are paid more? Well, they own KPIs that the company cares about. Finance owns 3 key figures:

* Revenues
* Profits
* Cash flow

All 3 are easy to summarize but can be complex to analyze, understand and, especially, project and forecast. Therefore whoever is doing this is extremely valuable, even if their work is primarily done by analyzing spreadsheets.

We should note that it's not just the numbers that count but also the way they relate to each other. Understanding cash flow requires a strong understanding of revenue and costs. Forecasting cash flow requires, additionally, a strong business understanding in order to translate any future planned activity into a potential revenue or cost impact.

Companies go through various stages and prioritize differently at each stage. An early startup that just received their funds will be laser focused on growth. A small business or more mature startup will start focusing on profits. A small margin business will be focusing on profits and probably cash flow. If interest rates go up cash flow is more important, if they go down it becomes less important. The point is, the challenge of the analytics department is to have a good idea of what the current financial priorities are in order to be plugged in the key discussions.

> * If none of our KPIs can be tracked back to any of the 3 figures above, find new KPIs

### Do we have interfaces with the stakeholders that make the key decisions?

We normally like to work with departments that understand us better and believe in the things we do. This, however, can be a problem if it ends up excluding the critical departments that make the key business decisions.

This has been a key mistake in my own professional career, as multiple times I dedicated a lot of time and effort to developing relationships with the wrong stakeholders. This can be very frustrating in bigger organizations as we do a lot of work that eventually does not get fair recognition.

This does not mean that we should drop working for stakeholders that are not held in high regard by the company's leadership, but we should spend enough time in building the right bridges with the critical stakeholders, too.

Especially if our analytics department is new or if it's going through a transformation we want to think about *branding* and how we are perceived by the organization. Working with important stakeholders is a strong signal to everybody else that we are doing something critical and relevant.

### Do we have a technical architecture that is flexible and sustainable in the long run?

If we are going through our assessment and are thinking of delivering better results in terms of 1) alignment of KPIs to financials and 2) stronger relationships with key stakeholders, we will very quickly hit the topic of execution.

Executing well on analytics projects is, of course, extremely important. If we are going through a re-branding of our analytics functions any execution issue will be to the detriment of our credibility.

Unfortunately, I often see companies putting together an analytics architecture that is neither fit for the purpose at hand nor sustainable. Sustainability, in particular, is often considered only when things break, but it should be proactively sought after. Since analytics is technical and normally not done in Excel, making sure that the team is able to continue to support the solution as life happens and people leave can be extremely challenging. It becomes even more challenging if we took the wrong architectural decisions at the beginning and put together solutions that are hard to maintain.

### Conclusions

We have gone through a few of the key items in assessing an analytics functions and deciding its future direction. This is a very high level overview of what to do as part of a serious assessment, therefore  I have left a lot of information out to make this article more digestible.

I am in no way saying that all analytics departments are in need of a transformation or that they need to become more relevant. I am saying that this has been my experience with some of the people that have contacted me and that, if you are in this situation, you need to be very mindful about how you approach the assessment and ultimately the changes you want to implement.

Analytics is a very broad field, and it's hard to hit all the key issues for everybody. The lack of relevancy and the paradox of other numbers driven functions being valued more is however quite real. If you are thinking of changing the way your company does analytics, you need to address the type of value analytics should generate. This is a very complicated and theoretical exercise, but if you look at where value is being generated today with data you will get more than a few clues on what needs to be done.
