Dashboards are not having a good impact on analytics

Here is a quick question to you: what's more valuable? A dashboard or a good decision?

You will be tempted to say: well, dashboards *enable* decisions, right?

Unfortunately they do not. Dashboards can be very useful but they are still not decisions. In fact, a decision is a decision.

Personally I think commoditizing graphs and charts online has been a good thing. Before companies were spending millions (I am not joking) to do this sort of thing with outsourced contractors. So at least those tools are giving power back to in-house analysts.

But I also think that the hype of data visualization has damaged the reputation of the analytics and BI industry. I have seen plenty of scenarios of badly implemented dashboards that looked good but made business users angry and frustrated because they did not provide the information needed to make good decisions.

This is not different from what is happening with AI, ML, Big Data and so on so forth. But dashboards are so easy to implement compared to those other solutions, they have done more damage this way.

The gap that I see today is a gap of *exploration* not a gap of *visualization*. Users struggle with dashboards because they only offer limited exploratory capabilities. For instance connecting data sources, also known as data blending, is still more easily done in Excel with vlookups.

And I get why the industry went this way, because building dashboard tools is immensely easier than building data analytics tools. It is very hard to beat spreadsheets when it comes to playing with and manipulating data.

But I also think that pushing visualizations is hurting the credibility of the BI and analytics industry, because they are so clearly **not** a game changer although they get marketed as such.

So what's the solution? I don't think there is a solution today that can help close the data exploration gap for non technical users, but there is a lot available for more tech savvy users.

I think that cheap, easy to scale, parallel clusters are

Now a data analyst with some tech skills can crunch gigabytes or even terabytes of data in minutes. This will evolve to users with no programming skills eventually and it will be a significant improvement over spreadsheets.
