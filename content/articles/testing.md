What is an Analytics Center of Excellence and why it matters more more more

With an estimated world data size to hit [175 Zettabytes in 2025](https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/our-story/trends/files/idc-seagate-dataage-whitepaper.pdf), analytics and data science are well positioned to continue on an explosive growth trajectory. But how are companies approaching the growing need for the extraction of useful information from data? Especially, will they reorganize their teams or will things go unchanged? And shouldn't we all be doing AI and Automation anyway?

Before digging into this topic, it is important to understand that currently the industry is not settled on standard solutions.  For instance, I have seen IT departments that tend to favor data virtualization, even though this approach might for now be [more theoretical than others](https://sonra.io/2018/10/11/the-future-of-etl-and-the-limitations-of-data-virtualisation-and-noetl/). Even data science is not yet [strictly defined](https://m.signalvnoise.com/data-scientists-mostly-just-do-arithmetic-and-thats-a-good-thing/). I believe, however, that exactly due to this lack of standards that focusing on **teams** and, more specifically, CoE's, could provide bigger benefits than focusing on technical software selection.

Well trained and highly motivated employees are more likely to be able to navigate the complexities of this industry and stay flexible as new solutions become available.

And before you ask about AI, [so far it has failed to deliver](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-02-13-gartner-says-nearly-half-of-cios-are-planning-to-deploy-artificial-intelligence):

> Gartner predicts that through 2022, 85 percent of AI projects will deliver erroneous outcomes due to bias in data, algorithms or the teams responsible for managing them.

And when it delivers, also according to Gartner, is because companies have developed strong in-house capabilities. Point being, a lot of the success of AI and data driven projects in general is really dependent on having strong teams in place in the first place.

### A quick intro to CoE's

So, what is a CoE anyway? Here is the wiki definition:

> A **center of excellence** (**CoE**) is a team, a shared facility or an entity that provides leadership, [best practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice "Best practice"), research, support and/or training for a focus area.

I normally refer to CoE's as ACoE's (Analytics Center of Excellence).

Carme Artigas [well describes why companies might need ACoE's and how they provide value](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-need-an-analytics-center-of-excellence):

* **Lack of standards**. As also described above there are not many clear standards in the industry as of 2019. This also creates confusion in organization that results in companies implementing a constellation of solutions without a well defined strategy
* **Lack of skills**. The type of work required from an analyst today can vary a lot but the constant is that it requires a good mix of technical and business skills. These roles are hard to find as in the past people have focused more on one or the other
* **Lack of prioritization**. In order for analytics to succeed, its priorities need to align with business priorities. Without a central focal point the risk is that IT and analysts prioritize the wrong things or, worse yet, are fully consumed with the day to day operations and not with supporting the development of a numbers driven culture

I agree completely with Carme's article and will now go into more detail on some of the reasons for setting up ACoE's and provide my personal insights.

### Why are ACoE's important?
There are many good reasons to build an ACoE and there are some [good introductions](https://deloitte.wsj.com/cfo/files/2014/03/achieving_Analytics_Excellence_part2.pdf) on this topic. The way I see it, we can identify 4 top reasons.

The first and most important reason, from my perspective, is **talent**. Now managers talk often about talent but they never get specific about it. The employees that perform best in data projects are well prepared technically, but they also have the communication and organization skills to manage things on their own. In fact, I think ACoE's tend to work best in flatter structures, without too many project, IT or system managers involved. This type of talent is more rare than others, but it can be found. However, I believe that it performs poorly if the company does not have the right structure for it; ACoE's can provide the proper environment for them.

The second reason to get an ACoE going is **change management**. Change management often gets missed in business intelligence project rollouts, but getting people to adopt new solutions and processes can be very challenging. This is the type of work that requires a team with both strong communication and technical skills, which is very hard to put together unless it is designed like this from the ground up. At its core, change management is solving customer problems and patiently talking them through the solution by either meeting face to face or on video calls. But it also requires listening, getting feedback, and iteratively improving the solution  to make sure users don't feel they have to put up with an inflexible monolith. In a lot of ways, an ACoE is there to do [things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html), as Paul Graham would put it.

The third reason is **IT collaboration**. However technical the ACoE might be, it is unlikely that it will be able to run all the IT operations needed. Normally, what tends to happen in such situations is that the team tries to implement as much as possible on their own, resulting in sub-optimal scenarios.

Finally, a fourth reason is **executive focus**. Executive focus is especially needed if we want to measure the value of analytics in terms of ROI. In order to achieve positive ROI, business users must act on the data insights in a timely and specific way. This does not usually happen unless there is a strong desire from executives to make it happen. The ACoE's do not live in an isolated world and getting people to act on their advice will require a tight executive alignment and buy in.

### Conclusions
If your organization wants to roll out a serious analytics initiative to move towards more data driven decision making, setting up an ACoE could be a critical first step in the direction of its successful development.

ACoE's come in many different shapes and definitions, but at their core they are interdepartmental teams that house the right talent with best practice knowledge and the right organizational structure. ACoE's are normally willing to support users as they adopt the new solutions by, counter-intuitively, doing things that don't scale.

Setting up ACoE's is not easy, but many consulting firms and software vendors do offer good insights on how to form them correctly. so if possible don't do this alone.
