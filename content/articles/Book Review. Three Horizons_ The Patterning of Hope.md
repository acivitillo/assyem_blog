Book Review. Three Horizons, the Patterning of Hope
2019-10-26
Change

As I continue to have discussions with people working in analytics, BI and enterprise software I keep noticing a recurring theme. This theme is not so much about technology, but more about dealing with growing, daunting, complexity. Very often after hours and hours of discussion we end up convincing ourselves that the best ways forward are either quickly patching up the current way, however flowed, or just doing nothing.

This, of course, doesn't work well in the long term as the current system is flowed and eventually it will come to a breaking point. At that point we find ourselves dealing with massive breakage that has to be fixed quickly which means burnout and lots of shortcuts that end up in another flowed system.

What I just described is a chain of events that I see happening again and again in companies, startups, teams, research groups. It is not surprising, then, that one of the strongest themes of Sharpe's book in 3 Horizons is hope. Hope for a better way, hope for a way to apply change constructively and intentionally.

In this article  I want to provide a review of Sharpe's book *Three Horizons: The Patterning of Hope (2013)*. Amazon link [here](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Horizons-Patterning-Bill-Sharpe/dp/1909470244). I believe this book is extremely helpful in dealing with the type of change we often need in **analytics, BI and enterprise software solutions**.

### Key ideas of the book

* Transformative change is that change that requires a re-patterning rather than an extension of the current pattern
* 3 Horizons. The first horizon (H1) describes the current way of doing things. The third horizon (H3) is the future system, new ways of working and living that fit better with emerging trends. The second horizon (H2) is the transition and transformation zone from H1 to H2
* Seeing everything as patterns. ***Cognitive priming** -- once we are primed to see something it can easily pop into our attention*
* Changing in complex situations: *redesigning the plane whilst flying it*
* A change *viral in nature* is a change that others will adopt because it works, not because it's imposed top down
* Bringing *evidence from the future* into the present conversations

### Understanding H1, H2 and H3

As I was learning this framework I noticed that I was assuming H1 to H3 happening in linear time. I was looking at the various horizons happening one after the other. This is not incorrect thinking as the horizon framework was initially conceived this way. Given today's speed of change, though, this is [considered a flow](https://steveblank.com/2019/01/08/the-fatal-flaw-of-the-three-horizons-model/).

Sharpe (2013) circumvents this flaw by focusing on what characterizes each horizons and putting less emphasis on time of change.

Sharpe describes H1 systems as those in which the managerial voice is concerned with the responsibility of keeping things going on - keeping the lights on. Interestingly, this does not mean H1 lacks innovation. Innovation in H1 systems happens but *it is focused on sustaining and extending the way things are done now in a planned and orderly way*.

> For example, every time we see managers building big scary spreadsheets we are looking at an H1 system. As those spreadsheets become bigger and more difficult to maintain, excel users will look into VBA as an opportunity for improving their workflow. VBA is a type of H1 innovation as it is not a different way of doing work but an extension of Excel and hence of an existing system.

In H3 we give ourselves the possibility of discussing *visionary action*. Here our focus is to see what can be achieved by dropping the H1 way of doing things and re-patterning rather than merely extending our current patterns.

> For example, we see a big scary spreadsheet and we start considering moving this complex, but valuable, data model into a system professionally programmed and maintained with a version control tool like git. But we don't stop there, we continue with our visionary action and start considering improving the entire model and process. What can be done once we move to a better technology? Can this model be improved or fully automated? Can we increase the business impact by x multiples?

H2 is a transitional system from H1 to H3. Since this is a transition system it follows that H3 has to be defined first so normally we do H1, H3, H2. Why? The idea is to have a vision and leveraging that vision to trigger the H2 improvements.

From my point of view, H2 systems are extremely important as that's where the **quick wins** can be situated. In any change we apply we should always consider what type of quick wins can be put together to show results quickly. Humans (and management) struggle with long term goals that don't deliver results for a very long time. We should look at H2 as a way for us to deliver and gain credibility to then push for H3 type of changes.

H2, being close to H1, is also the place where things can stall. Sharpe has a nice term: *H2 capture*. H2 capture is the tendency of leveraging H2 improvements not to move towards H3 but to stay in H1.

> H2 capture happens often in analytics and enterprise software. For example, if we have a big scary spreadsheet and we implement some quick automation in Python without versioning, without a database, without thinking of increasing the business impact by x multiples. In this way we have delivered some H2 improvements using Python, but we have mostly extended an H1 process and not delivered a real transformative change

### Understanding views of individuals in different horizons of each other

Here is a nice table in Sharpe's book that can give us a quick oversight of what individuals might think of others in different horizons that theirs. Being aware of various perspective is a critical tool for change management and bringing people together into the new changes that need to be made.

|              | H1 view of H1s                                                                    | H1 view of H2s                                                               | H1 view of H3s                                                                                                   |

## Making this actionable

Making three horizon actionable is normally quite easy. The one thing I suggest is to read Sharpe's book too as there are a lot of insights in that book that might get dismissed in the common consulting practice of this framework.

1) If you want to test things out though or if you need to take action quickly, the first advise would be to make yourself and other people aware of the 3 horizon (feel free to send them to this article!). As you learn to bring *evidence from the future* into present conversation the quality of discussion will improve and the H1, H2 and H3 individuals will be able to come to better agreements for what needs to be done

2) Consider phrases like *redesigning the plane whilst flying it* or *keeping the lights on* to convey the message that it's important to keep the system working but also to be cognizant of the future

3) Be aware of the table above. This simple table will be extremely useful in building bridges with individuals in various horizons. Approaching them with the type of things that matter to them

4) Sharpe doesn't go very deep into it but his insight on *viral in nature* can be very effective. Try to think of how to apply changes that are so easy to adopt or improve things so much that they are viral and users want to adopt them. Top-down adoption does not work well and it's also a lot more difficult to put together as you need to convince a lot of C-suite stakeholders to bear your message
